=============================================================================
Vexilla Nationum  -  National flag font
=============================================================================


DESCRIPTION

    This font intends to include figures of the world's national flags.


SPECIFICATION

    Fonts are monochrome, and cannot deal with colors.  Therefore this font
uses Petra Sancta's system for colors which should be distinguished.

    Code points from U+1F1E6 to U+1F1FF are intended to represent national
flags with biliteral country code.  ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 is used for the
country code; for example JP for Japan, IT for Italy, RU for Russia.
    Exceptionally, SU is the code for no-longer-existent Soviet Union.  AQ is
officially assigned for Antarctica, but it is territory of no country and
no official flags exist.

    For systems without glyph composition, you may use the code point in the
Private Use Area.  U+ECC1 is assigned for AA (user-assignable code), U+ECC2
for AB (unassigned), &c. to U+ECDA which is for AZ (Azerbaijan).  For BA
(Bosnia and Herzegovina), assigned in U+ECE1, similarly BZ (Belize) at U+ECFA,
ZZ (user-assignable code) at U+EFFA.
